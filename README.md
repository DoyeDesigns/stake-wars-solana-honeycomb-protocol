## 🎮 Game Overview  

StakeWars lets players mint, train, and command elemental ninja characters from four elite villages. Players can:  

- Engage in **fast-paced PvP duels** powered by dice rolls.  
- Send their ninja on **missions and staking quests** that earn XP and gold(chakra) while idle.  
- **Level up**, unlock abilities, acquire village-specific tools, and climb competitive leaderboards.  

The core loop is simple but deep:  

1. Select or mint a ninja character (NFT).

2. Choose a mode: PvP, PvE, or Missions/Staking.

3. Roll dice to determine ability usage in combat.

4. Win battles or complete missions → earn XP & gold(Chakra). 
5. Level up, evolve traits, buy resources → repeat.  

**PvP and PvE matches last ~2–3 minutes.** Missions and staking are idle, lasting hours to a full day. Returning early forfeits rewards.

## 🔹 How Honeycomb Powers StakeWars  

Honeycomb Protocol is the backbone of StakeWars’ on-chain progression, making every player action, contribution, and identity meaningful. Here’s how it fits:  

### 1. **Missions and Quests – Permanent, Verifiable Rewards**  

When a player sends a ninja on a mission or staking quest:  

- **Mission start and duration are recorded on-chain.** This ensures that rewards are earned honestly—no cheating or resets.  
- **XP and gold(Chakra) rewards are linked directly to the user profile.** The ninja literally “carries” its progress.  
- **Early recall is penalized** automatically by the protocol; unfinished missions yield no rewards.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Players’ contributions are permanent and verifiable.  
- Missions persist across devices and sessions.  
- Rewards are trustless: the blockchain is the source of truth.   

---

### 2. **Trait Assignment and Evolution – Ninja Identity On-Chain**  

Every ninja NFT comes with **traits** assigned at minting:  

- Elemental type (Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Lightning)
- Ninja villages (Hidden Leaf, Hidden Sand, Hidden Mist, Hidden Cloud)
- Predefined abilities
  - Attack abilities (4 per ninja)  
  - Defense abilities (2 per ninja, e.g., dodge, block, reflect)  

  *![Predefined attributes image](./public/attributes.png)* 

As the player earns XP:  

- **Levels are recorded on-chain.** Each level increases attack power or unlocks new abilities.
- **Identity is portable:** if a ninja NFT is traded, the new owner inherits its full progression.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Players own their ninja identity and evolution.  
- Traits and stats are transparent and verifiable by anyone. 

---

### 3. **On-Chain Progression and Experience Systems**  

Every XP gain, level-up, and gold(chakra) reward is **tracked on-chain**:  

- Leveling increases attack power: +5 per level for all attack abilities.  
- Gold(chakra) purchases tools or resources in the village-specific marketplace.  
- Achievements, contributions, and battle outcomes are permanently tied to the NFT.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Progress cannot be erased or reset.  
- Players’ contributions are **trustless and verifiable**.  
- On-chain progression allows **reputation systems, skill trees, and loyalty mechanics** to be built directly into gameplay.

## 📈 Player Loop – How Your Actions Matter  

1. Mint or select your ninja NFT.  
2. Choose PvP, PvE, or idle missions.  
3. Roll dice to determine abilities in combat.  
4. Win or complete missions → **earn XP & gold(chakra) on-chain**.  
5. Level up → evolve traits → acquire resources.  
6. Repeat: each action adds permanent value to your ninja NFT.  

**Every dice roll, mission, or level-up is meaningful.** Honeycomb tracks it all.  

---

## 🏪 Marketplace & Resources  

- Trade resources and tools on-chain using gold(chakra).  
- All ninja NFTs are **fully tradable**, with progression and traits intact.  
- Marketplace supports village-specific upgrades to reinforce identity and strategy.

## ✨ Why StakeWars is Different  

- **Player actions are permanent:** Every mission or battle outcome is tracked on-chain.  
- **Identity is meaningful:** Each ninja NFT evolves with the player, not just visually.

## Business Model

The **StakeWars** business model is designed for sustainability within the **Solana ecosystem**, with a focus on building a strong player community, forming ecosystem-aligned partnerships, and ensuring long-term engagement through clear monetization and retention strategies.  

### Community Building  
- **Gamified engagement:** Leverage in-game leaderboards, missions, and progression to encourage ongoing participation.  
- **Social incentives:** Players are motivated to invite friends and grow organically through referral rewards and achievements.  
- **Open communication:** Use Discord, Twitter (X), and Solana community forums to foster dialogue, share updates, and gather player feedback.  

### Partnerships  
- **Ecosystem alignment:** Collaborate with Solana-native protocols, validators, and DeFi projects to create in-game missions that integrate staking mechanics.  
- **Cross-project synergies:** Work with NFT collections and gaming guilds to expand visibility and utility within the broader Solana ecosystem.  
- **Support from infra providers:** Potential collaborations with RPC providers, wallets, and analytics tools to reduce friction for onboarding new players.  

### User Acquisition  
- **On-chain incentives:** Reward early adopters with unique badges, points, or leaderboard recognition.  
- **Referral growth:** Encourage players to bring new users through referral bonuses tied to progress in StakeWars.  
- **Community-driven campaigns:** Host tournaments, AMAs, and community quests in collaboration with Solana DAOs and projects.  

### Monetization  
- **Microtransactions:** Offer optional cosmetic upgrades (avatars, themes, badges) for personalization.  
- **Ecosystem-backed rewards:** Partner with Solana protocols for sponsored missions, where projects provide token or NFT rewards to boost visibility.  
- **Sustainable token use:** Ensure that in-game rewards remain tied to real staking behavior, reinforcing Solana’s validator ecosystem rather than introducing unsustainable token inflation.  

### Retention  
- **Progression systems:** Level-ups, achievements, and missions keep users striving toward long-term goals.  
- **Seasonal events:** Regularly introduce time-limited challenges to maintain fresh gameplay loops.  
- **Community recognition:** Highlight top players and contributors publicly across social channels and in-game.  

### Key Metrics  
To measure business model success, StakeWars will track:  
- **Daily Active Users (DAU) & Monthly Active Users (MAU)**  
- **Retention rate (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30)**  
- **Referral conversion rates**  
- **Validator partnerships & sponsored missions completed**  
- **In-game microtransaction revenue**  

This model ensures StakeWars remains sustainable, deeply integrated into the **Solana ecosystem**, and capable of scaling through community, partnerships, and ongoing engagement.
